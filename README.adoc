= hawtio testing infrastructure

The goal of this project is to provide configurable environment that can simulate multiple link:http://hawt.io[hawtio]
kinds of configurations of back-end servers (e.g., JBoss Fuse).

link:http://hawt.io[hawtio] console can connect to any remote link:http://jolokia.org[Jolokia agent] and provide
hawt web UI for managing JMX beans exposed by agent.

== A need for simulation

Sometimes we'd like to connect to Fuse server that exposes information about thousands of ActiveMQ queues and tens of
Apache Camel contexts - it may be hard to set up such environment, especially if we lack server infrastructure.

That's why hawtio-testing was created. Just add it as Maven dependency, add some _plugins_ to classpath, run
`mvn jetty:run` and point your link:http://hawt.io[hawtio] console to started Jetty instance.
